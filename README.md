# Sticky-Notes

It is a web app that I built to practice React which provides functionalities such as create, update, delete and read notes. At the moment, the data is not persistent as I plan to learn and integrate Redis key-value (KV) database.

## Servers

### Server-Express

Server express is a project generated with [Express Generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) which provides a backend server based on Express (duh).

Execute `DEBUG=myapp:* npm start` to launch the server at port `3000`.
